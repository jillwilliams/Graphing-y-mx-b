    <h1>
        Graphing y = mx + b
    </h1>
    <p>
        The equation y = mx + b will always produce a graph of a perfectly straight line. The line may go upwards or downwards. It can even be horizontal or vertical!
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two ways to graph a line when it's equation is written in slope-intercept form: y = mx + b.<br>
        1. Use a table of values<br>
        2. Use the intercept and the slope<br>

        Using a Table of Values
    </h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Creating a table of (x, y) coordinates to plot in order to create the image of the graph is the most common approach to graphing. You can pick as many x-values as you'd like, there is no limit. Each x-value gets substituted into the equation. The answer is always the y-coordinate. Together they create points (x, y) to plot on a coordinate axis to create your line.
    </p>
    <p>
        <hr>
        Step One: create a table of values by choosing values for x.<br> 
        Step Two: Substitute each value into the equation for x. Simplify to get the answer, the y-coordinate. 
        Step 3: Then create ordered pairs using your x-values and y-values.<br>
        Step Four: Plot them on a coordinate axis and you are done! You can use the same steps for every equation.<hr>

        Using the y-intercept and the Slope
    </h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The second method to graph a line is using the numbers they give you in the equation in order to graph the line.<br>
        It is harder at first, but it will save you time compared to making a table of values.<br>
        <hr>
        The 2 numbers in the equation are called the slope and the intercept. The intercept is plotted on the y-axis at its appropriate location.<br>
        The slope is drawn with your pencil at the point for the y-intercept. Then a second point is made.<br>
        Connect the 2 points making a line with a ruler. Put arrows at both ends of your line. This shows the graph goes on in both directions. And you are done! No calculations necessary to graph a line. And the best part is it works the same for all lines!

        Let's look at an example:<br>
        Graph y = 4x - 6<br>
        The slope is always the number infront of the variable x. The slope is 4.<br>
        The y-intercept is the number not with the variable x. The y-intercept is -6.

    <p>
        Let's look at an example:<br>
        Graph y = 7x + 3<br>
        The slope is always the number infront of the variable x. The slope is 7.<br>
        The y-intercept is the number not with the variable x. The y-intercept is 3.

    <img src="images/img20.png" alt="ex 2" id="img20" />

    <p>
        Let's look at an example:<br>
        Graph y = -3/4x + 7<br>
        The slope is always the number infront of the variable x. The slope is -3/4.<br>
        The y-intercept is the number not with the variable x. The y-intercept is 7. 
    </p>
    <img src="images/img21.png" alt="ex 3" id="img21" />
    <img src="images/img22.png" alt="ex 3" id="img22" />
    <img src="images/img23.png" alt="ex 3" id="img23" />
    <hr>
    <p>
        Let's look at an example:<br>
        Graph y = 2/3x + 3<br>
        The slope is always the number infront of the variable x. The slope is 2/3.<br>
        The y-intercept is the number not with the variable x. The y-intercept is 3.

    <p>
        The difficult part to remember using this method is when adding the slope to the graph. I gave 4 different examples. Each one had slope. But 2 were fractions and 2 were whole numbers.
        <hr>
        Rule: If the slope value is not a fraction, make it one by turning it into a fraction by giving it a denominator of 1.
        If the slope value is already a fraction skip this step.
        <br>
        1. The number on the top of the fraction is how many spaces to move up (if it's a positive number), and down (if it's a negative number).<br>
        2. The number on the bottom of the fraction is how many spaces you move right, then put a point at that location. Connecting this point to the y-intercept's point will create your graph.<br>
        3. Remember you can also choose not to use this technique and use a Table of Values to graph the line instead. It creates the same answer. It is your choice which technique you use.
